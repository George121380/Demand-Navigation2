1. The indoor ambiance feels a bit dry, could we somehow increase the humidity in the room?
2. The interior seems to lack vibrancy, can we add some colorful items or decor to liven up the space?
3. The room gets quite stuffy during the day, maybe we can adjust the airflow to make it more comfortable?
4. I find the current room temperature a bit hot, can we make it slightly cooler?
5. The noise from outside distracts me when I'm trying to work, could we soundproof the room in any way?
6. The room gets quite dim after sunset, could we add some ambient lighting to illuminate the space in the evenings?
7. The lack of greenery doesn't feel quite right, could we incorporate some plants in our decor?
8. The existing seat isn't that comfortable, can we replace or cushion it for a comfier workspace?
9. The clutter around the place tends to overwhelm me, can we possibly figure out a better organization or storage method for things?
10. The room is lacking a few personal touches, could we customize some elements to make the space feel more like my own?
